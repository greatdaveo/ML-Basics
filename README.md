# 🧠 ML Labs

Welcome to **ML Labs**, a hands-on repository where I document and keep track of my learning process in **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Deep Learning (DL)**, and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. This repo includes all the practical exercises, code notebooks, and projects tackled throughout my learning journey.

## 📚 What This Repo Covers

- 📌 Foundational ML concepts (Supervised, Unsupervised Learning, etc.)
- 📊 Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
- 🤖 Model Training and Evaluation (Scikit-Learn, StatsModels)
- 🧮 Mathematical foundations (Linear Algebra, Probability, Calculus)
- 🧠 Deep Learning with TensorFlow and PyTorch
- 🗣️ Natural Language Processing (Text Classification, Tokenization, Embeddings)
- 🧪 Real-world projects (Healthcare, Finance, E-Commerce)
- 🧰 Tools: Jupyter, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch

> This repo is a practical journey through both theory and real-world implementation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/greatdaveo/ML-Labs.git
cd ML-Labs
```

### 2. Set up a virtual environment

Using **Conda**:

```bash
conda create -p venv python=3.10
conda activate venv/
```

Or using **virtualenv**:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
